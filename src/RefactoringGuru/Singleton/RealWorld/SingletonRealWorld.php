 * Singleton Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Ensure that a class has a single instance, and provide a global point
 * of access to it.
 *
 * Example: The Singleton pattern is notorious for limiting code reuse and
 * complicating unit testing. However, it is still very useful in some cases. In
 * particular, it's handy when you need to control some shared resources. For
 * example, a global logging object that has to control the access to a log
 * file. Another good example: a shared runtime configuration storage.

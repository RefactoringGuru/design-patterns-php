/**
 * Prototype Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Produce new objects by copying existing ones without compromising
 * their internal structure.
 *
 * Example: The Prototype pattern provides a convenient way to replicate
 * existing objects instead of reconstructing them and copying over all of
 * their fields directly. The direct approach not only couples you to the
 * classes of the objects being cloned, but also doesn't allow you to copy the
 * contents of the private fields. The Prototype pattern lets you perform the
 * cloning within the context of the cloned class, where the access to the
 * class' private fields is not restricted.
 *
 * This example shows you how to clone a complex Page object using the Prototype
 * pattern. The Page class has lots of private fields, which will be carried
 * over to the cloned object thanks to the Prototype pattern.

/**
 * Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Avoid coupling a sender of a request to its receiver by giving more
 * than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects
 * and then pass the request through the chain until some receiver handles it.
 *
 * Example: The most widely known use of the Chain of Responsibility (CoR)
 * pattern in the PHP world is found in HTTP request middleware. These are 
 * implemented by most popular PHP frameworks and even got standardized as part 
 * of PSR-15.
 *
 * It works like this: an HTTP request must pass through a stack of middleware
 * objects in order to be handled by the app. Each middleware can either reject
 * the further processing of the request or pass it to the next middleware. Once
 * the request successfully passes all middleware, the primary handler of the
 * app can finally handle it.
 *
 * You might have noticed that this approach is kind of inverse to the original
 * intent of the pattern. Indeed, in the typical implementation, a request is
 * only passed along a chain if a current handler CANNOT process it, while a
 * middleware passes the request further down the chain when it thinks that the
 * app CAN handle the request. Nevertheless, since middleware are chained, the
 * whole concept is still considered an example of the CoR pattern.
 */

/**
 * The classic CoR pattern declares a single role for objects that make up a
 * chain, which is a Handler. In our example, let's differentiate between
 * middleware and a final application's handler, which is executed when a
 * request gets through all the middleware objects.
 *
 * The base Middleware class declares an interface for linking middleware
 * objects into a chain.

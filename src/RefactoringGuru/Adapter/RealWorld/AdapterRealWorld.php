/**
 * Adapter Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Convert the interface of a class into the interface clients expect.
 * Adapter lets classes work together where they otherwise couldn't, due to
 * incompatible interfaces.
 *
 * Example: The Adapter pattern allows you to use 3rd-party or legacy classes
 * even if they are incompatible with the bulk of your code. For example,
 * instead of rewriting the notification interface of your app to support each 
 * 3rd-party service such as Slack, Facebook, SMS or (you-name-it), you can 
 * create a set of special wrappers that adapt calls from your app to an 
 * interface and format required by each 3rd-party class.
 */

/**
 * The Target interface represents the interface that your application's classes
 * already follow.
 */

{
    public function send(string $title, string $message);
}

/**
 * Here's an example of the existing class that follows the Target interface.
 *
 * The truth is that many real apps may not have this interface clearly defined.
 * If you're in that boat, your best bet would be to extend the Adapter from
 * one of your application's existing classes. If that's awkward (for instance,
 * SlackNotification doesn't feel like a subclass of EmailNotification), then
 * extracting an interface should be your first step.

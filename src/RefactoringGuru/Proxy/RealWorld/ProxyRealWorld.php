/**
 * Proxy Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control
 * access to the original object or to add other responsibilities.
 *
 * Example: There are countless ways proxies can be used: caching, logging,
 * access control, delayed initialization, etc. This example demonstrates how
 * the Proxy pattern can improve the performance of a downloader object by
 * caching its results.

/**
 * The Subject interface describes the interface of a real object.
 *
 * The truth is that many real apps may not have this interface clearly defined.
 * If you're in that boat, your best bet would be to extend the Proxy from one
 * of your existing application classes. If that's awkward, then extracting a
 * proper interface should be your first step.

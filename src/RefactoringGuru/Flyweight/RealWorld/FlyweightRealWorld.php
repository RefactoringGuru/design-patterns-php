/**
 * Flyweight Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Use sharing to fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by
 * sharing common parts of the object state among multiple objects, instead of
 * keeping the entire state in each object.
 *
 * Example: Before we begin, please note that real applications for the
 * Flyweight pattern in PHP are pretty rare. This stems from the single-thread
 * nature of PHP, where you're not supposed to be storing ALL of your
 * application's objects in memory at the same time, in the same thread. While
 * the idea for this example is only half-serious, and the whole RAM problem
 * might be solved by structuring the app differently, it still demonstrates the
 * concept of the pattern as it works in the real world. All right, I've given
 * you the disclaimer. Now, let's begin.
 *
 * In this example, the Flyweight pattern is used to minimize the RAM usage of
 * objects in an animal database of a cat-only veterinary clinic. Each record in
 * the database is represented by a Cat object. Its data consists of two parts:
 *
 * 1. Unique (extrinsic) data such as a pet's name, age, and owner info.
 * 2. Shared (intrinsic) data such as a breed name, color, texture, etc.
 *
 * The first part is stored directly inside the Cat class, which acts as a
 * context. The second part, however, is stored separately and can be shared by
 * multiple cats. This shareable data resides inside the CatVariation class. All
 * cats that have similar features are linked to the same CatVariation class,
 * instead of storing the duplicate data in each of their objects.
 */

/**
 * Flyweight objects represent the data shared by multiple Cat objects. This is
 * the combination of breed, color, texture, etc.
 */
class CatVariation
{
    /**
     * The so-called "intrinsic" state.
     */
    public $breed;

    public $image;

    public $color;

    public $texture;

    public $fur;

    public $size;

    public function __construct($breed, $image, $color, $texture, $fur, $size)
    {
        $this->breed = $breed;
        $this->image = $image;
        $this->color = $color;
        $this->texture = $texture;
        $this->fur = $fur;
        $this->size = $size;
    }

    /**
     * Display the cat information. The method accepts the extrinsic state as
     * arguments. The rest of the state is stored inside Flyweight's fields.
     *
     * You might be wondering why we had put the primary cat's logic into the
     * CatVariation class instead of keeping it in the Cat class. I agree, it
     * does sound confusing.
     *
     * Keep in mind that in the real world, the Flyweight pattern can either be
     * implemented from the start or forced onto an existing application
     * whenever the developers realize they've hit upon a RAM problem.
     *
     * In the latter case, you end up with such classes as we have here. We kind
     * of "refactored" an ideal app where all the data was initially inside the
     * Cat class. If we had implemented the Flyweight from the start, our class
     * names might be different and less confusing. For example, Cat and
     * CatContext.
     *
     * However, the actual reason why the primary behavior should live in the
     * Flyweight class is that you might not have the Context class declared at
     * all. The context data might be stored in an array or some other more
     * efficient data structure. You won't have another place to put your
     * methods in, except the Flyweight class.

/**
 * Composite Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
 * hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions
 * of objects uniformly.
 *
 * Example: The Composite pattern can streamline the work with any tree-like
 * recursive structures. The HTML DOM tree is an example of such a structure. 
 * For instance, while the various input elements can act as leaves, the complex
 * elements like forms and fieldsets play the role of composites.
 *
 * Bearing that in mind, you can use the Composite pattern to apply various
 * behaviors to the whole HTML tree in the same way as to its inner elements
 * without coupling your code to concrete classes of the DOM tree. Examples
 * of such behaviors might be rendering the DOM elements, exporting it into 
 * various formats, validating its parts, etc.
 *
 * With the Composite pattern, you don't need to check whether it's the simple
 * or complex type of element before executing the behavior. Depending on the
 * element's type, it either gets executed right away or passed all the way
 * down to all element's children.
